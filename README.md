## Welcome to EmordnilaPalindromE

This is a quick, easy place to check you palindromes. 
For letter based palindromes, just paste it in (don't worry about punctuation and spaces). Entries over 20 letters will be displayed on the welcome screen.  But all valid submissions will be displayed in the gallery. 
For binary palindromes, go to the binary view - 1's and 0's only please.  
What about genomic palindromes?  You can check those too!



## Usage

Go to the 'Try It Yourself' view and enter a palindrome.  Emordnilap will varify it and then add it to the gallary. It will tell you hown many letters it is.  If over 20 letters, it will be appended to the Welcome view.
